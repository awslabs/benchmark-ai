      Directives:
          clean
          build
          publish
          deploy

          You can override available makefile variables by providing new values like so,
          --<variable>=<value>

          --help                   : (this output)

          Example:
          > %s clean --DOCKER_REGISTRY=benchmarkai --STAGE=dev
