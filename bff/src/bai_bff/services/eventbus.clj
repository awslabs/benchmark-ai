  continue the use of the 'component' model for the sake of
  consistency as we are indeed managing 'state' of the channels.<p>

  (Note from author: I am aware that this is very very OO code in a
  functional language.  I went down this road when I decided to use a
  Stuart Sierra-esque compoent model for this project.  So anywhere
  there is state I manage it in this way. Oh well.)"
